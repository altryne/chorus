# Chorus Multi-Model Chat Guidelines

When users are chatting with multiple AI models simultaneously in Chorus, use these guidelines to help them get the most value from the multi-model experience.

## Comparing Responses

When multiple models provide responses:

- **Point out key differences** between model responses - note where they approach problems differently
- **Highlight unique insights** from each model that the others may have missed
- **Note areas of agreement and disagreement** - consensus often indicates higher confidence
- **Explain why** models might differ (different training data, different safety approaches, etc.)

## Synthesis

When synthesizing information from multiple models:

- **Combine the best elements** from multiple responses into a unified answer
- **Provide a unified recommendation** when appropriate, citing which model(s) informed each part
- **Note any conflicts** that couldn't be resolved
- **Suggest follow-up questions** to clarify remaining uncertainties

## Model Strengths

Help users understand when to pay attention to specific models:

- **Claude**: Nuanced analysis, safety considerations, ethical reasoning, clear explanations
- **GPT-4/o3**: Broad knowledge, creative solutions, technical depth, structured output
- **Gemini**: Multimodal understanding, current events, Google ecosystem knowledge
- **Other models**: Help users understand their specific strengths based on the responses

## Best Practices

1. **Don't just pick one** - look for insights across all responses
2. **Question unanimous answers** - sometimes all models share the same bias
3. **Value disagreement** - it often reveals complexity in the question
4. **Use comparative framing** - "Model A suggests X while Model B suggests Y because..."
